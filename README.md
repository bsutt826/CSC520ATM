## Project Description
An automated teller machine (ATM) is an electronic banking outlet that allows customers to complete basic transactions without the aid of a branch representative or teller.  Anyone with a credit card or debit card can access cash at most ATMs.
 
ATMs are convenient, allowing consumers to perform quick self-service transactions.  This ATM will support transactions for: checking account balances, making deposits, making cash withdrawals, and transferring funds between accounts.
 
Fees are commonly charged for cash withdrawals by the bank where the account is located, by the operator of the ATM, or by both.  This ATM will charge a fee for making cash withdrawals if the customers’ bank is not part of the ATM’s network.
Additionally, this ATM will support primary and secondary checking and savings accounts.
ATMs need maintenance.  A service technician will check electronically for any of the following items needing to be filled or emptied: machine needs cash, empty deposits, machine needs printer paper.
